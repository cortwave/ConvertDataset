# Convert Dataset

A tool to generate prompts for LLM to convert datasets between formats easily. The tool analyzes the source and target datasets and generates a prompt which you can use with your favourite LLM to get a Python script that can perform the conversion.

## Features 🔄

- 🔍 Analyzes source and target datasets to describe their formats.
- 🖌️ Generates a prompt for an LLM to produce a Python script for dataset conversion.
- ⏬ Outputs the generated prompt in the terminal for easy usage.

## Installation ⚙️

```bash
pip install convert-dataset
```

## Usage 🚀

Run the `convert-dataset` command from the terminal with the paths to the source and target datasets:

```bash
convert-dataset <source_dataset_path> <target_dataset_path>
```

This will output a prompt for your favorite LLM to generate a Python script for converting the datasets. Just copy the prompt and paste it into your LLM's interface to get the conversion script.

* Please, pay attention on TODOs in the generated script to fill in the necessary information. ℹ️
